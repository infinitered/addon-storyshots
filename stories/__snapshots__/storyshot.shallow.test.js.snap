    Welcome to storybook
  </glamorous(h1)>
  <p>
    This is a UI component dev environment for your app.
  </p>
  <p>
    We've added some basic stories inside the 
    <glamorous(code)>
      src/stories
    </glamorous(code)>
     directory.
    <br />
    A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want.
    <br />
    (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
  </p>
  <p>
    See these sample
     
    <glamorous(glamorous(glamorous(a)))
      onClick={[Function]}
    >
      stories
    </glamorous(glamorous(glamorous(a)))>
     
    for a component called 
    <glamorous(code)>
      Button
    </glamorous(code)>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like that, you can add your own components as stories.
    <br />
    You can also edit those components and see changes right away.
    <br />
    (Try editing the 
    <glamorous(code)>
      Button
    </glamorous(code)>
     stories located at
     
    <glamorous(code)>
      src/stories/index.js
    </glamorous(code)>
    .)
  </p>
  <p>
    Usually we create stories with smaller UI components in the app.
    <br />
